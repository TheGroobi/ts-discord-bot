# ðŸŽµ TypeScript Discord Bot

> [!CAUTION]
> The bot currently is not usable due to some dependencies changed, yt-dlp-wrap has been deprecated and errors out. (I'm looking to fix this issue sometime soon).

This is a simple Discord bot written in TypeScript that provides basic music playback functionality using `yt-dlp` wrapper written in ts.
The bot allows users to play, pause, and stop music in a voice channel.

## Features

-   **Ping Command (`/ping`)** â†’ Responds with `"Pong!"`
-   **Play Command (`/play <youtube-link>`)** â†’ Downloads the song, converts it to Opus, and plays it. If a song is already playing, it adds the track to a queue.
-   **Pause Command (`/pause`)** â†’ Pauses the currently playing song.
-   **Quit Command (`/quit`)** â†’ Disconnects the bot from the voice channel.
